# photogrammetry_2

## First Week’s Report
In my homework, I first found the unknown parameters and the 
coefficient matrix. I then created new pixel values. But I did not get a
image output.

## Second Week’s Report
In the second part of the assignment, I found sigma naught, 
parameter correlation and standard deviation values for each 
transformation and showed them on the plot.

## Third Week’s Report
In the third part of the assignment, I could not obtain any photo 
output, So I could not get any result of the codes I researched and 
written. So I am sending you the code I wrote. I researched and 
learned what is conscious interpolation. I did my best to write my 
own code without using the library. I have done more research on 
the subject by doing strict research. But I had a hard time doing 
research, and this assignment was tiring for me but also educational
